# WFT
### Hello, and welcome to **WFT**.

This is the offical recode of my old plugin WFT, witch had some issues. Overall I was not happy with the result, the code was messy, it was all in one file, there was useless and in-efficent code, with a hard api to use, so decided to recode it.

I have added features, because I felt the plugin needed them, and removed features, as some of the features where not needed.

## Features added

- Optional display identifier
- More Tags
- Per-Player Texts
- Packet Texts over Entity
- More efficent and pretty code

Display identifier: You can now turn on or off the option to see the texts unique identifer (Much like texter, but optional)

More tags: Added many more tags for better, they are also player spasific.

Per-Player texts: Players will now get a spasific text depending on what tag you use.

Packets: The old plugin used entitys, putting more load on the server, whereas this plugin uses packets, therefor creating a more lightweight plugin.

Efficent and pretty code: The code in this plugin is WAY more efficent and clean that the old plugin. The code is also spaced out in multiple files.

## Features

- Refresh timer
- Tags for various things
- Lots of useful commands
- Form or command line options
- Help subcommand for new people 
- Powerful fast and efficient code
- Extensive customizability

## API

Example:

Import the classes
```php

use WolfDen133\WFT\WFT;
use WolfDen133\WFT\Texts\FloatingText;

```
Creating the text
```php
// Creation and regirstration
$floatingText = new FloatingText(new Position($x, $y, $z, $level), $name, $text);
WFT::getAPI()->registerText($floatingText);

// Spawning
WFT::getAPI()::spawnTo($player, $floatingText);
// or
WFT::getAPI()::spawnToAll($floatingText);
```

Changing the ft's text
```php
// Changing the text
$floatingText->setText($text);

// Pushing the update
WFT::getAPI()::respawnTo($player, $floatingText);
// or 
WFT::getAPI()::respawnToAll($floatingText);
```
Thats it! The rest is handled by the plugin.
