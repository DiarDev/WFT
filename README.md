# WFT
Hello, and welcome to **WFT**.

This is the offical recode of my old plugin WFT, witch had some issues. Overall I was not happy with the result, the code was messy, it was all in one file, there was useless and in-efficent code, with a hard api to use, so decided to recode it.

I have added features, because I felt the plugin needed them, and removed features, as some of the features where not needed.

## Features added

- More Tags
- Per-Player Texts
- Packet Texts over Entity
- More efficent and pretty code


More tags: Added many more tags for better, they are also player spasific.
Per-Player texts: Players will now get a spasific text depending on what tag you use.
Packets: The old plugin used entitys, putting more load on the server, whereas this plugin uses packets, therefor creating a more lightweight plugin.
Efficent and pretty code: The code in this plugin is WAY more efficent and clean that the old plugin. The code is also spaced out in multiple files.
